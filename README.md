## üñãÔ∏è Prose:

<pre>
In the realm where thoughts and words entwine,
Lies a land of whispers, in twilight's decline.
Shiggs and shirks, in shadows they gleam,
Echoes of ancient tales, in dreams they seem.

The Shiggerse roams, with steps so soft,
Through the brambles and moss, in silence aloft.
Its eyes like moons, in the night it sings,
A lullaby sweet, on enchanted wings.

In forests old, by rivers wide and deep,
The Shiggerse dances, while others sleep.
It weaves a spell, of wonder and light,
Guiding lost souls, through endless night.

Yet heed the caution, as dawn breaks anew,
For the Shiggerse fades, and day's light is true.
Its magic lingers, in memories held dear,
Until dusk returns, and it reappears.
</pre>
